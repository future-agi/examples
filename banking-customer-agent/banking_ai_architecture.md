## Data Flow Architecture

```
Customer Query → Input Validation → Intent Classification → Planning Module
                                                                ↓
Memory System ← Context Enrichment ← RAG System ← Knowledge Retrieval
     ↓                                                         ↓
Execution Engine → Banking Tools/APIs → Response Generation → Self-Reflection
     ↓                                                         ↓
Response Validation → Security Check → Customer Response → Feedback Loop
```

## Banking-Specific Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Identity verification processes
- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Transaction monitoring and reporting
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry data security standards
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial reporting accuracy
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data privacy and protection

### Security Features
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time transaction monitoring
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all communications

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for all interactions

### Banking Use Cases
- **Account Management**: Balance inquiries, transaction history, account updates
- **Transaction Processing**: Transfers, payments, bill pay
- **Product Information**: Loans, credit cards, investment products
- **Customer Support**: Issue resolution, complaint handling
- **Financial Advisory**: Basic financial guidance and product recommendations

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent scaling of components
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across multiple instances
- **Database Sharding**: Partitioning of data for improved performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data

### Performance Optimization
- **Response Time**: Target <2 seconds for simple queries, <5 seconds for complex
- **Throughput**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with redundancy and failover
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized memory and CPU usage

## Integration Points

### Core Banking Systems
- **Account Management Systems**: Real-time account data access
- **Transaction Processing**: Secure transaction execution
