# Font Generator Demo Requirements

## Overview
This application will generate custom font samples based on user input describing an occasion, purpose, or desired font style. The application will use OpenAI's latest 4o image generation model to create 5 different font samples that match the user's description.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Input**
   - Accept text input describing the desired font style, occasion, or purpose
   - Examples: "Wedding invitation font", "Cyberpunk game title", "Professional business card font"

2. **Font Generation**
   - Generate 5 different font samples based on the user's description
   - Each sample should show the alphabet or a sample text in the generated font style
   - Ensure consistency in the generated font styles
   - Ensure readability and quality of the generated fonts

3. **User Interface**
   - Implement a clean, intuitive Gradio interface
   - Display input field for user's font description
   - Display generated font samples in a visually appealing way
   - Include a "Generate" button to trigger the font generation process
   - Show loading indicators during generation

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Integrate with OpenAI's 4o image generation API
   - Craft effective prompts to generate high-quality font samples
   - Handle API errors and rate limits gracefully
   - Optimize image quality and loading times

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Reasonable response time for font generation (considering API limitations)
   - Efficient handling of image processing

2. **Usability**
   - Intuitive interface that requires minimal explanation
   - Clear feedback during processing
   - Responsive design

3. **Reliability**
   - Graceful error handling
   - Appropriate user feedback for failures

## Implementation Approach

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Develop effective prompts that consistently generate high-quality font samples
   - Include specific instructions to ensure the output is a font sample rather than general images
   - Use consistent formatting for all generated samples

2. **Image Generation Strategy**
   - Generate images showing the alphabet or sample text in the requested font style
   - Ensure consistent sizing and formatting across all generated samples
   - Consider generating samples with different variations (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, etc.)

3. **User Experience Flow**
   - User enters description
   - User clicks "Generate" button
   - Loading indicator appears
   - 5 font samples are displayed when ready
   - User can enter a new description to generate more samples
