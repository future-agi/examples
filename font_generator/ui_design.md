# Font Generator UI Design

## Overview
The Gradio interface will provide a clean, intuitive user experience for generating font samples based on user descriptions. The design focuses on simplicity while providing clear visual feedback during the generation process.

## Layout Components

### Input Section
- **Title**: "Font Generator" (prominent at the top)
- **Description**: Brief explanation of how to use the app: "Describe the occasion, purpose, or style of font you're looking for, and we'll generate 5 custom font samples for you."
- **Text Input Field**: Large text area for users to enter their font description
  - Placeholder text: "E.g., 'Elegant wedding invitation font', 'Retro 80s arcade game title', 'Modern tech company logo'"
- **Generate Button**: Prominent button labeled "Generate Font Samples"
- **Examples**: Quick-select buttons with common font requests to help users get started

### Processing Feedback
- **Loading Indicator**: Visual spinner or progress bar during generation
- **Status Message**: Text updates on the generation process (e.g., "Generating your font samples...")

### Output Section
- **Results Title**: "Your Custom Font Samples" (appears when results are ready)
- **Font Sample Display**: Grid layout showing 5 font samples
  - Each sample shows the alphabet or sample text in the generated font style
  - Consistent sizing and formatting across all samples
  - Clear visual separation between samples
- **Sample Text**: Each font sample will display:
  - The alphabet (uppercase and lowercase)
  - Numbers 0-9
  - Sample text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
- **Regenerate Button**: Option to generate new samples with the same description
- **Download Options**: Allow users to download individual font samples as images

## Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Clean, professional palette
  - Primary: #3B82F6 (blue)
  - Secondary: #1E40AF (dark blue)
  - Background: #F9FAFB (light gray)
  - Text: #111827 (dark gray)
- **Typography**: Sans-serif fonts for UI elements for readability
- **Spacing**: Generous padding and margins for clear visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
  - Desktop: Grid layout for font samples (3x2 or 5x1)
  - Mobile: Vertical stack of font samples

## User Flow
1. User arrives at the application
2. User enters a description in the text input field
3. User clicks "Generate Font Samples" button
4. Loading indicator appears
5. When complete, 5 font samples are displayed in the output section
6. User can enter a new description or regenerate samples with the same description

## Error States
- **API Error**: Clear message explaining the issue and suggesting retry
- **Empty Input**: Prompt user to enter a description
- **Generation Timeout**: Message explaining the delay and offering retry option

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast between text and background
- Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
- Alt text for generated images
- Semantic HTML structure
