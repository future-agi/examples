# Enhanced Product Recommendations with AI-Generated Images

## Overview

The e-commerce agent now features enhanced product recommendations that include both product information and **AI-generated realistic product images**. When users ask for product recommendations, the system will:

1. **Analyze the query** using AI to understand user intent
2. **Filter products** from the database based on criteria
3. **Generate or retrieve photorealistic product images** using DALL-E or Gemini
4. **Display recommendations** in a beautifully formatted way with high-quality images

## New Features

### 🎨 AI-Powered Image Generation
- **DALL-E 3 Integration**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 to generate photorealistic product images
- **Gemini Support**: Fallback to Google's Gemini for image generation (when available)
- **Smart Prompts**: Category-specific prompts for optimal image quality
- **Intelligent Fallback**: PIL-based placeholders if AI generation fails
- **Image Caching**: Generated images are saved and reused for performance

### 📱 Enhanced UI
- **Product Gallery**: Displays recommended products in a visual grid with realistic images
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Product details include emojis and structured information  
- **Responsive Design**: High-quality images adapt to different screen sizes

### 🤖 Smart Recommendations
- **AI-Powered Filtering**: Uses LLM to extract search criteria from natural language
- **Multi-step Processing**: Analyzes query → filters products → ranks results → generates images
- **Context Awareness**: Considers user images if provided

## How It Works

### 1. User Query Processing
```
User: "I want to buy some blue running shoes"
```

### 2. AI Analysis
- Extracts criteria: `{"type": "shoes", "category": "athletic", "color": "blue"}`
- Filters product database
- Ranks results by relevance

### 3. AI Image Generation
- Checks if product images exist
- Generates missing images using DALL-E 3 with category-specific prompts:
  - **Clothing**: "Fashion photography style, clean background, well-lit studio lighting"
  - **Electronics**: "Clean tech product photography, modern minimalist style, white background"
  - **Footwear**: "Professional shoe photography, clean white background, detailed textures"
  - **Home/Kitchen**: "Home goods photography, lifestyle context, clean and modern"
- Downloads and saves high-quality images (1024x1024px)
- Falls back to Gemini or placeholders if needed

### 4. Response Formatting

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # For DALL-E image generation
```

### Image Settings
- **AI Model**: DALL-E 3 (primary), Gemini (fallback)
- **Resolution**: 1024x1024 pixels (high quality)
- **Format**: PNG
- **Storage**: `generated_products/` directory
- **Naming**: Based on product name (e.g., `blue_cotton_t_shirt.png`)
- **File Size**: ~1-1.6MB per image (high quality)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recommendation
```
User: "Recommend some electronics"
Agent: Displays 3 electronics with photorealistic AI-generated images
```

### Color-Based Search
```
User: "Show me black accessories"
Agent: Filters for black-colored accessories and shows realistic product photos
```

### Image-Based Recommendations
```
User: *uploads image* "Find similar products"
Agent: Analyzes image and recommends matching products with AI-generated images
```

## AI Image Generation Scripts

### Generate Realistic Product Images
```bash
python generate_test_images.py
```

**Features:**
- 🎨 **DALL-E 3**: Primary AI image generator
- 🔮 **Gemini**: Fallback option (when implemented)
- 🎭 **Smart Fallback**: PIL placeholders if AI fails
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time generation status
- ✅ **Skip Existing**: Won't regenerate existing images

**Sample Output:**
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **ProductRecommender.ensure_product_images_exist()**: Checks and generates missing images
2. **OpenAIHelper.generate_image()**: DALL-E 3 integration
3. **generate_test_images.py**: Batch AI image generation script
4. **Gradio Gallery**: Visual product display with high-quality images
5. **Enhanced UI**: Rich text formatting and responsive image grid

### AI Image Generation Pipeline

```
Product Data → Smart Prompt Creation → DALL-E 3 API → Image Download → Local Storage
     ↓              ↓                      ↓              ↓             ↓
Category-based   Detailed prompt    High-quality     Save as PNG   Cache for reuse
